# React Router DOM Unexpected Navigation Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in React Router DOM v6 where navigation between routes doesn't function as expected under certain conditions, leading to blank pages or unexpected behavior.  The issue is often seen after multiple navigation actions.

The bug.js file showcases the problematic code. bugSolution.js offers a possible solution, though the root cause might require deeper investigation into the specific use case and application setup. 

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.
4. Navigate between the Home and About pages repeatedly.  The issue will likely manifest after several transitions.

## Potential Causes
* **Incorrect Route Definitions:** While the provided example appears straightforward, complex nested routes or dynamic routes may introduce subtle errors that are difficult to track.
* **Component Lifecycle Issues:** Component lifecycle methods (e.g., `componentWillUnmount`) not correctly handling cleanup of navigation events or state might interfere with routing.
* **Conflicting Libraries:** Interactions between React Router DOM and other libraries, particularly state management libraries (Redux, Zustand, etc.), could cause conflicts.
* **Incorrect Usage of `useLocation` or `useParams`:** Improper use of hooks within routing components might impact state updates and navigation.
* **Browser Caching:** In some instances, the browser cache might contribute to unexpected behavior. Try clearing your browser cache for testing.

## Possible Solutions (See bugSolution.js)
The provided solution offers a revised version that may resolve the issue in some instances by adding a check to ensure the routes correctly switch.  However, a thorough examination of the entire application might be necessary to pinpoint the precise cause.
